            "Daizz's tips:-Growing flowers from seed can be a difficult task for beginning gardeners. Seeds and seedlings are delicate, and the wrong conditions can ruin them fairly easily. In order to achieve the best results, plant your seeds indoors into a small, sterile container using professionally packaged potting soil. Follow the instructions on the back of your seed packet and provide plenty of light and water to your growing seedlings. Once the flowers have developed strong enough roots, transplant them into your garden.",

            "Basic parts of most all plants are roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds. The roots help provide support by anchoring the plant and absorbing water and nutrients needed for growth. They can also store sugars and carbohydrates that the plant uses to carry out other functions. The root system, which supports the plants and absorbs water and minerals, is usually underground. Example plant organ systems: The shoot system of a plant consists of leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. The root system anchors the plant while absorbing water and minerals from the soil.",

            "We know youâ€™ve heard of Venus fly traps, the most famous of all carnivorous plants. Weâ€™ve seen them in cartoons and learnt about them in school. But there are many more like them out in the world, it would take them weeks to just digest just the tip of a human finger. If we are alive when they chomp down on our finger, by the time they start to break the finger down, we would have already healed. So, their choice of prey is usually insects because theyâ€™re easier to digest, and preferably dead ones so they canâ€™t heal themselves.",
