The market here is developing and hopefully plants like these will soon be common, but these are either the first time I have seen them in my local nursery or after quite a long gap. I also included prices of each of the plants.",

However it takes a very long time for them to digest their food… it would take them weeks to just digest just the tip of a human finger.
